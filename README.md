## Useful Commands

- `npm run start` or `npm run dev`

  - Starts a development server accessible by default at http://localhost:8000. Gatsby will start a hot-reloading development environment.

- `npm run test`

  - Runs all test cases. Currently there are no that have been written yet.

- `npm run build`
  - Builds the app for production to the build folder.
    It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
